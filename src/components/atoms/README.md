# Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of our UI. They are the smallest, most fundamental components that cannot be broken down further.

## Examples:
- Buttons
- Inputs
- Labels
- Icons
- Badges
- Avatars
- Typography components

## Usage:
```tsx
// Direct import - no index files needed
import { Button } from '@/src/components/atoms/Button';
```
